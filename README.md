# README Generator App

## Description

This is a command line application that users can use to create a README file for their projects simply by answering a few questions that are prompted to them from the command line.

## Installation

This application requires the user to install node.js onto their computer as well as download the files from this repo that are required for the app to run. 

## Usage

To use this application, the user needs to open their command line terminal and make sure that they are in the directory where they installed the files for this application. Once there in the command line, the user can type node index.js to run the program. Once the program starts, the user will be asked a series of questions that will take their answers and generate a README file for their project. The user will be prompted to enter a Title for their project, a description, provide installation instructions, instructions on how to use their application, provide guidelines for other users to contribute, and list examples for how to run tests for their app if they included any. Then the user will choose from a list of available licenses that they want to license their project under. There is an option for no license if the user doesn't wish to license their app. They will then be prompted to enter their GitHub user name, and their email to be added to a questions section where users can contact them with any questions that they have about the application. After the user answers all of these questions a README.md file will be created for them.

To see how this works please watch the following video of this app in action:
